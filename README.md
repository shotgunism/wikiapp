wikiapp - Updtr. - Version 1.0
=======
This is the final project for Udacity's CS 253 WebApp Development course.

The running version can be found here: http://wikiapp-smp.appspot.com/

The app allows signed in users to set-up new pages with any topics and then modify them.

Future versions will include a history page where all previous modifications will be seen as well 
as a front page where each user submission can be tracked.
